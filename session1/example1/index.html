      Skynet, the supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John Connor</span> is the
      focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition.
      After repeated failures at terminating

      Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators to
      various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war

      On the brink of extinction,
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John Connor</span> united the
      despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome
      the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these
      survivors.

    <p>
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John Connor</span> led the
      human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the
      year <u>2029</u>. In order to eliminate

      sent a

      on <u>February 28, 1985</u>. His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine
      months prior in <u>May 1984</u>, protecting
      <span style="color: lightslategray; font-style: italic">Sarah</span>
      from a time-traveling Terminator.
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John's</span> early life was
      filled with training by various persons his mother
      <span style="color: lightslategray; font-style: italic">Sarah</span> had
      met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the
      Terminator. Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry,
      computer technology, and espionage.

      When
      <span style="color: lightslategray; font-style: italic"

      was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the
      early <u>1990s</u>,
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John</span> was placed into
      foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely
      delusions. He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled,
      edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a
      police record (which included trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the
      peace, and vandalism) by the time he was <u>10 years old</u>. His foster
      parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with
      him, and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door
      asking to speak with
      <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">John</span>.
