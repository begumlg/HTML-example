    </p>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <h3>Childhood and family</h3>
    <p>
      Elon Reeve <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> was born on <u>June 28, 1971</u>, in Pretoria, one of the capital
      cities of apartheid South Africa.[8][9] His mother is Maye <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> (nÃ©e
      Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised
      in South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>, a South African
      electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
      developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake
      Tanganyika.[13][14] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a
      younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather,
      Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his
      family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to
      Africa and Australia.[16][17][18] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
      ancestry.[19][20] He was baptized into the Anglican Church.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>'s family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the
      Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid
      Progressive Party, with the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> children reportedly sharing their
      father's dislike of apartheid.[8] After his parents divorced in <u>1980</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>
      mostly lived with his father,[19] a choice he made two years after the
      divorce and subsequently regretted.[23] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> has become estranged from his
      father.[23] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.
    </p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
      Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>
      applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[32][33]
      While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria
      for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South
      African military.[34] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a
      second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[35] working odd jobs at a farm
      and lumber-mill.[36] In <u>1990</u>, he entered Queen's University in Kingston,
      Ontario.[37][38] Two years later, he transferred to the University of
      Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in
      physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton
      School in <u>1995</u>.
    </p>
    <p>In <u>1994</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> held two internships in Silicon Valley during
        the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which
        investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the
        Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[41] In <u>1995</u>, he was accepted
        to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford
        University in California.[42] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> tried to get a job at Netscape but
        never received a response to his inquiries.[32] He dropped out of Stanford
        after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch a
        startup.</p>

    <h2>Business career</h2>

    <h3>Zip2</h3>
    <p>
      In <u>1995</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software
      company Zip2 with funds borrowed from <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>'s father.[44][23] They housed
      the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[45] The company
      developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing
      industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[46] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> says that
      before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and
      instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and
      shared one computer with his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it
      at night, seven days a week, all the time."[45] The <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> brothers obtained
      contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48] and
      persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with
      CitySearch.[49] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>'s attempts to become ceo were thwarted by the
      board.[50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February
      <u>1999</u>,[51][52] and <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> received $22 million for his 7-percent share./p>
    </p>
    <h3>X.com and Paypal</h3>
    <p>
      In <u>1999</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail
      payment company.[54] The startup was one of the first federally insured
      online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000
      customers joined the service.[55] The company's investors regarded <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> as
      inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit ceo Bill Harris by the end of
      the year.[56] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity
      to avoid competition.[45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter
      Thiel,[58] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was
      more popular than X.com's service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the merged company, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> returned as ceo. <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span>'s preference for
      Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused
      Thiel to resign.[60] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a
      cohesive business model, the board ousted <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> and replaced him with Thiel
      in September <u>2000</u>.[61][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal
      service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[63][64] In <u>2002</u>, PayPal was
      acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> -the largest
      shareholder with 11.72% of sharesâ€”received $175.8 million.[65][66] In
      <u>2017</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed
      amount, explaining it has sentimental value.
    </p>
    <h3>SpaceX</h3>
    <p>
      In early <u>2001</u>, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and
      discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[69]
      In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo
      Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that
      could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO
      Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> was seen as a novice[70] and the
      group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February <u>2002</u>, the
      group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look
      for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered
      one rocket for $8 million, which <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> rejected. He instead decided to
      start a company that could build affordable rockets.[70] With $100 million
      of his early fortune,[71] Musk founded <span style="color:red ; font-style: italic;">SpaceX</span> in <u>May 2002</u> and became the
      company's ceo and Chief Engineer.
    </p>
    <p><span style="color:red ; font-style: italic;">SpaceX</span> attempted its first launch of the
        Falcon 1 rocket in <u>2006</u>.[74] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth
        orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program
        contract from NASA Administrator (and former <span style="color:red ; font-style: italic;">SpaceX</span> consultant[75]) Mike
        Griffin later that year.[76][77] After two more failed attempts that
        nearly caused <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <span style="color:red ; font-style: italic;">SpaceX</span> succeeded in
        launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in <u>2008</u>.[78] Later that year, <span style="color:red ; font-style: italic;">SpaceX</span>
        received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from
        NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the
        International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its <u>2011</u>
        retirement.[79] In <u>2012</u>, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first
        for a private enterprise.[80] <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Musk</span> credited the NASA award, one of the
        last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the
        company.</p>
